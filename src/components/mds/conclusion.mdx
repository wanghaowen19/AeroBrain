# Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced AeroBrain, an innovative UAV navigation system that seamlessly integrates large models with DRL to enable efficient, autonomous navigation driven by natural language instructions. By leveraging the advanced perception and reasoning capabilities of large models for high-level decision-making and employing the SAC algorithm for responsive and adaptive path planning, AeroBrain addresses the challenges of navigating complex and dynamic environments.
Experimental results conducted in a simulated factory environment demonstrated AeroBrain’s superior performance in trajectory efficiency, navigation accuracy, and success rate when compared to existing navigation methods.  Moreover, our evaluation of AeroBrain’s adaptability across different large models and various path planning scenarios further validated its robustness and generalization capability. The integration of historical information and the optimization of planning distances were shown to significantly enhance performance.
AeroBrain represents a significant advancement in the field of autonomous UAV navigation, offering a flexible, reliable, and efficient solution for natural language-driven tasks. Future work will explore the deployment of AeroBrain in real-world environments and extend its capabilities to support multi-UAV coordination and more complex mission planning.
