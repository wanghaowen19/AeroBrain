# Conclusion

This paper presents AeroBrain, a novel UAV navigation framework that integrates MLMs with DRL to enable autonomous navigation based on natural language instructions.
AeroBrain leverages large models for high-level decision-making and employs the SAC algorithm for adaptive path planning, addressing challenges in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results in a simulated factory environment demonstrate AeroBrainâ€™s superiority in trajectory efficiency, navigation accuracy, and success rate compared to existing methods. Additionally, evaluations across different large models and path planning scenarios confirm its robustness and generalization. The integration of historical information and optimized planning distances further enhance performance.
AeroBrain represents a significant advancement in autonomous UAV navigation, providing a flexible, reliable, and efficient solution for natural language-driven tasks. Future work will focus on real-world deployment, multi-UAV coordination, and more complex mission planning.
